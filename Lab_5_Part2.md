# Part 2 - Create a Bingo card

This example will give you practice using \`\`fork and pull" with
Github. You can read more about this in [Chapter
30](https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone.html#fork-and-clone) of
Happy Git with R.

We have created a repository on GitHub that allows you to make bingo
cards using R:

-   You can find this
    [here](https://github.com/craigalexander/DAS_Bingo)
-   Read the README file here to learn how this package works!

## Task

-   Fork the `bingo` repo.
-   Clone this to your local device
-   Create a new bingo card by making a file of possible squares.
    -   Follow the instructions in the CONTRIBUTING.md file (which can
        be
        found[here](https://github.com/craigalexander/DAS_Bingo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md))
        to see how to add a new card.
-   Feel free to run the tests and check the package if you wish. Or
    skip this step!
-   Commit your changes!
-   Push your changes back to your copy of the repo on GitHub
-   Make a pull request back to the main `bingo` repo.
-   If your card is appropriate, I will merge your request and it will
    become a part of the package and added to the [Shiny
    app](https://stats-glasgow.shinyapps.io/Bingo/)
